# A.1 Factorial

Write a program which takes a single argument, computes the factorial and prints the value on the screen.

    $ factorial 5
    5! = 120

Ext 1: Change the program so that it computes the factorial iteratively and recursively.

Ext 2: Change the program so that it is interactive instead of terminating after each computation and that it uses a table of previous values to improve the performance.
